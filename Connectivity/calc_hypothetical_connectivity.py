# calc_hypothetical_connectivity.py
#
# Takes as arguments the number of nodes, the degree, and ACV. Based on these inputs
# creates a network and examines if the network is connected using the networkx python
# library. This script uses the variable loops to set the choose the number of 
# scenarios to average and outputs the percentage of those scenarios where the 
# network is connected.
# 
# Note: if "test" is passed via the command line instead of an ACV the script is in 
# test mode and examines whether with an ACV of 100% is the degree equal the desired 
# degree. The script test_calc_hypothetical_connectivity.py uses this feature to
# test this script.
