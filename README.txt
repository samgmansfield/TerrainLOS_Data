TerrainLOS is a propagation model that uses real terrain maps from the Shuttle 
Radar Topogrophy Mission (SRTM) to determine if nodes can communicate. It is
currently implemented in COOJA, a simulator for the Contiki OS.

Included in this repository is source code and instructions on how to install
TerrainLOS as well as tools used to analyze TerrainLOS.
