# calc_duplicates.py
# 
# This script calculates the percentage of duplicate packets sent based on the
# corresponding logs. The analyzed text file is read and any line that does not have an entry
# for the duplicate percentage is examined and calculated.
#
# To calculate the duplicate percentage each packet is tracked, using the packet's unique identifier,
# at each hop and the amount of hops until the packet reaches its destination.
# Each time a hop is recorded that amount of transmissions is stored and if an additional log
# entry has the same amount of hops for the same packet those transmissions are stored as duplicates.
# Additionally all hops that are above the total amount of hops to reach the destination are
# counted as ducplicate transmissions. 
#
# The result is written back to the analyzed file in the form 
# "duplicates: (float)%
